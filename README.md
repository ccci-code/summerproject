# Coastal Summer Project
## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a website that solves the problem of coming up with meal ideas for the week.
## Description
A website will be created to solve the problems of coming up with meal ideas and then creating a shopping list for those desired meals. The project will allow a user to input meal ideas to a database in the form of a main dish, a side dish, and a vegetable dish. The user will then be able to request a certain number of meals and the software will return a random list based on all three categories. The user will be able to decline certain responses and the program will replace it with an alternative. If progress is swift, more features and functionality can be added. All work will be done just like it is with the mainline projects. The developers will collaborate together remotely using GitHub, the world's largest development platform. This will mirror real world experience in a development project.
